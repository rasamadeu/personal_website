            <p>
                This journey begins in 2015, when I enrolled in Mechanical Engineering at Técnico Lisbon. I was
                extremely
                excited to embark on this new challenge and meet new people. However, during the following year I heard
                about another course
                at Técnico, <b>Engineering Physics</b>. This course focused on <b>Physics</b>, which was my favourite
                subject growing up, and its curriculum was really interesting. Hence, I decided to change courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the school year, I applied to Engineering Physics and was unfortunately rejected.
                Nonetheless,
                I was
                commited to my plan, and in the next year I enrolled in some modules from this course as an
                extracurricular activity and reapplied once again at the end of year. This time around I was accepted
                and
                was ecstatic! Despite the rocky road, these two years were vital to my personal growth. I realized how
                <b>determined</b> I am and it boosted the belief that I'm able to achieve my goals given enough effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the journey was not an easy-breezy. This course was highly technical and the workload was
                enormous. Nonetheless, I absolutely do not regret this decision. I was inspired by teachers (not all
                though
                &#x1F605) and learned concepts
                that blew my mind. Some of my favourite subjects include <b>hamiltonian mechanics</b>,
                <b>electromagnetism</b>, <b>quantum mechanics</b>, <b> particle physics</b> and <b> Standard Model</b>.
                I
                also enjoyed the programming modules that laid a basic foundation of programming skills. Along the way,
                I
                made some new friendships that supported me throughtout this adventure.

            <h1> Interests </h1>

            <p>
                A childlike curiosity has guided me throughout my life. As a result, I have a huge range of interests.
                To
                be honest, maybe too many. The late Richard Feynman quote:
            </p>

            <p class="quote">
                "Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough."
            </p>
            <p>
                absolutely resonates with me. On the top of my head, the only (really) boring part of life in my opinion
                is
                burocracy. In Portugal, we have the saying:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                "Knowledge does not occupy space."
            </p>
            <p>
                a wise motto to live by if you ask me. As a result, I am fascinated by <b>Science</b>, <b>Nature</b>,
                <b>Art</b>, <b>Sports</b>... you name it.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Does this HTML and CSS look familiar?</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>Science</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever I discover
                a new subject I know nothing about, there is an urge to learn and dive deep into it. Unfortunately,
                there is
                not enough time to do this with every matter, so one has to make concessions. Personally, <b>problem
                    solving</b> and
                <b>critical thinking</b> stimulate me the most. This is the reason why <b>Physics</b> and
                <b>Mathematics</b>
                were my favourite subjects growing up. Furthermore, I recently started exploring <b>programming</b> and
                <b>Computer Science</b>, as these are extremely engaging and feel like a challenging game.

                I grew up in Vila Nova da Barquinha, a small city located near river Tejo. Near it, there is
                <b>Constância</b>, an adorable small village where the river Zêzere meets river Tejo, which has a
                special
                place in my
                heart. I strongly encourage you to visit it. In my teenage years I used to work there in the summer as a
                kayaking guide. I would go down the river with a group of tourists, enjoying the peaceful and
                breathtaking
                company of its margins. These are some of my happiest memories.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was fortunate to grow up in a country with such beautiful beaches. Ever since I was a kid, during
                summer
                vacations I would go to the beach with my family, and I spent the entire time in the sea, with my
                snorkeling
                glasses exploring the underwater scenery and searching for fishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I developed a love for <b>hiking</b>. Walking through trails listening to the sounds of the
                forest, appreciating landscapes during breaks and breathing fresh air fully restores my energy. I'm
                lucky to
                live near the <b> Arrábida's Natural Park</b>, that has some physically demanding but breathtaking
                trails.
                My
                favourite trail is the <b>Alto do Formosinho trail</b>: but beware, it is not for the faint of heart!

            <p> I consider myself a melophile. In my teen years I learned the guitar, both classical and electric, and
                my
                musical interest broadened as a result. At the time, I discovered <b> Led Zeppelin</b> and it was love
                at
                first sound. To this day it remains one of my favourite bands. I wondered what other gems were out
                there,
                and I started exploring more and more, and listened to many different musical genres. Here are some
                personal
                suggestions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Blues</b> - B.B. King, Albert King
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Heavy metal</b> - Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slipknot, SOAD
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rock</b>- Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Jeff Buckley, The Doors, The Beatles, Queen, Dire Straits,
                    Soundgarden
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Progressive</b>- Dream Theater (Metal), Steven Wilson (Rock), Pink Floyd (Rock)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are a lot of other genres I listen to (Reagge, Afrobeat, Rap, Jazz, Funk, Bossa Nova, ...), but
                the
                list was getting long enough &#x1F643. Below I have listed some <b>portuguese speaking musicians</b> you
                may
                not
                heard
                about but should definitely check in my opinion:

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>
                As the majority of portuguese kids, I grew up kicking around a football every school break I had.
                Besides
                this, I had <b>swimming</b> training for nearly a decade, so exercising became a vital part of my life.
                In
                the
                first years of university, having moved to Lisbon from a slow pace city, it was hard to manage time to
                practice
                sports, but I would ocasionally play futsal with some acquaintances. More recently, I started practising
                <b>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</b> at <b>Pantera Jiu-Jitsu Pinhal Novo</b>. The <b>comradery</b> among
                athletes
                immediately
                captivated
                me, and it has been an invaluable adition to my life, promoting a better health, both physically and
                mentally. It is an amazing stress relief! I have even been toying with the idea of competing!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1> Next steps </h1>
        <p>
            I am freshly out of university, and I'm currently <b>searching for a job</b>, either <b>in Portugal or
                abroad</b>, in
            software development. Ideally, I
            would like to work in a project related to Physics. But as I previously said, I'm extremely curious and
            interested in exploring new areas of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, I am continously exploring the world of software development, learning about new
            technologies, languages and concepts. Heck, I'll probably do some other projects after finishing this
            webpage! Regarding hobbies, I
            will continue <b>hiking the Arrábida Natural Park</b>, and I'm planning to return to the <b>local gym</b> to
            physically
            prepare
            myself for my first BJJ competition!
