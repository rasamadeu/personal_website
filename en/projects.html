            <h3> CKM unitarity puzzle with Abelian flavour symmetries</h3>
            <p> The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is considered to be one of the greatest theoretical
                achievements of Physics. It successfully describes three [electroweak (EW) and strong] out of the four
                fundamental interactions among the elementary particles known to mankind. However, we today know that
                it is an incomplete theory! For example, neutrino oscillations, which indicate that neutrinos are
                massive particles and that there is lepton mixing, is a phenomena
                that requires beyond the SM (BSM) physics in order to be accounted for. As a result, any experimental
                evidence
                or hint which contradicts the SM is crucial, since these help physicists to better understand the
                Universe.
            </p>
            <p> In my thesis, I adressed a recent development in the measurement of the first row of the
                Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which is in tension with the prediction of unitary quark mixing,
                commonly
                known as <b>Cabibbo angle anomaly</b>. The proposed model is a SM extension with a <b>vector-like quark
                    (VLQ)</b>. Furthermore, to increase the predictivity of the theory, the number of free parameters in
                the Yukawa and mass matrices is reduced by imposing <b>texture zeros</b> using <b>Abelian
                    symmetries</b>, while
                maintaining
                compatibility with
                data. To achieve this, the SM must be further extended with a second Higgs doublet. For more details,
                you
                can check my thesis <a href="../Thesis.pdf"><b>here</b><a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this project, I autonomously learned a lot about <b>Python</b>, specifically the <b>Numpy</b> and
                <b>iMinuit</b> packages,
                having developed several modules to obtain the major results in the thesis. The plots were made with
                <b>matplotlib</b>. The code is on my <a href=""><b>Github</b></a> page.

            <h3> This webpage</h3>
            <p> Yes, I know it is a bit "meta" to refer to my personal webpage as a project in my personal webpage...
                Gosh, let me stop saying personal webpage, it's getting a bit cringy. </p>
            <p> While watching the CS50's lecture on <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript</b>, I decided to
                challenge
                myself to create this website. The goal was to develop a basic understanding of these web development
                building blocks and to write everything myself.</p>
            <p> After many hours of reading documentation and guides in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org"><b>MDN
                        Web docs</b></a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/"><b>CSS tricks</b></a>, I learned concepts
                such as CSS selectors and properties, the <b>Flexbox</b>
                layout model, basic <b>DOM</b> manipulation with Javascript and <b>responsive web design</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project only scratches the surface of the world of web development, and there is
                still a lot to learn. Nonetheless, I think that
                my goals were achieved and I'm content with the final result. Everyone has got to start somewhere I
                guess!

            <h3>Simulation of two strings attached to a pendulum</h3>
            <p> This projects consists of a <b>GUI</b> which allows the user to control several parameters of the
                simulation.
            </p>
            <p> It consists of 3 panels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Plots</b>: displays two real-time plots of the motion. You can choose from a variety of
                    coordinates to display. </li>
                <li> <b>Simulation</b>: displays the motion of the masses and allows the user to control the speed of
                    simulation and collision with wall. </li>
                <li> <b>System parameters and Initial conditions</b>: allows the user to control the physical parameters
                    of the
                    masses and springs and set the initial conditions of the motion. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This program was written in <b>C</b>, and the GUI was built using the <b>GTK+</b> library. You can check
                the code <a href=""> <b>here</b></a>.</p>

            <h3> Summer Internship at <a href="https://www.lip.pt"><b>LIP</b></a>
            </h3>
            <p> This project consisted on the detection of muons resulting from <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray"><b>cosmic ray showers</b></a> in photodetectors to
                be installed at LIP.
            </p>
            <p> The data from these detectors would be registered in a server. My task was to
                develop a <b>GUI</b> that allows the client to visualize the muon rates in realtime, check the state of
                the
                server, control the high voltage of the detectors and start/stop the data acquisition. The network,
                server and experimental setup were the responsibility of my supervisors. The GUI was written in
                <b>C++</b>.
